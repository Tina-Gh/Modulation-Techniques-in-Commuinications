# Mobile Communications Project:

In this project we (me and my other 2 teammates: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fatemeh-aligolzadeh-a431a11a7/" target="_blank">Fatemeh Aligolzadeh</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/seyyed-ali-ebadi-209558141/" target="_blank">Ali Ebadi</a>) had to see how to distribute vaccines for the Covid-19 disease in Iran using mobile communications techniques. If someone discovers the vaccine for the Covid-19 disease, then it will probably be produced for a limited number and will be prioretized to some high-risk people in most of the countries. Finding which group of people should this vaccine be prioretized to, is of significant importance in order to stop the current pandemic of the 21 st century. Therefore, our group narrowed down the main problem of distributing the Covid-19 vaccines to the following sub problems:

<ol>
  <li>Finding the top-hit cities by the Covid-19 in Iran, by implementing DBSCAN algorithm in Python to cluster a specific number of cities according to our future vaccine supplies</li>
  <li>Finding which group of people should be prioretized, based on our vaccine resources and based on the country's Education policy for whether closing or re-oppening schools and universities</li>
  <li>Finding dangerous Zones ( = most crowded zones) in the chosen cities in stage 1</li>
</ol>

The code and the report are available in the "Mobile Communications Project.rar" file. We were supposed to write the report in Persian.
